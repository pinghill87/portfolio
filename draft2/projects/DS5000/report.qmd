# Voting Rates in Congressional Districts: Key Findings 

# Final Report

## Introduction

Voting is an important part of the democratic process, and increasing voter turnout is crucial in allowing all voices to be heard. Voter turnout varies significantly throughout districts, and understanding the variables that drive voter turnout can provide stakeholders with valuable information to increase voter participation.

## Objective  

The objective of this project is:  
1. To collect and clean relevant datasets related to voter turnout and population information.  
2. To perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key trends and patterns.  
3. To apply **unsupervised learning** techniques (clustering, dimensionality reduction) and **supervised learning** models (classification, regression) to uncover insights.  
4. To analyze specific factors such as race, education, or socioeconomic factors, and highlight any patterns or trends revealed in the data.

## Supervised Learning  

### Regression  

Linear regression model predicted voter turnout with moderate accuracy.  

- RMSE:
  
  - Linear Regression: 0.571
    - This means the model's predictions are, on average, 0.571 standard deviations away from the actual values.
  - Cross Validation: 0.588
    - 
  - Lasso Regression: 0.576 
- MAE:
  - Linear Regression: 0.465 
    - The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values is 0.465 standard deviations.
  - Cross Validation: 0.456
  - Lasso Regression: 0.469 
- R^2:
  - Linear Regression: 0.688
    - 68.8% of the variance in voter turnout is explained by the model
  - Cross Validation: 0.64
  - Lasso Regression: 0.682 

- Key Predictors: High School Graduate, Poverty Rate and Income, Internet Access, Median Age
  
- This model has implications for real-world use. However, with a moderately high prediction error, the model still requires further improvement and calibration before being reliably applied in real voting scenarios. Doing this will allow policymakers and analysts to gain insights and make educated decisions.

### Multi Classification

 Classifying districts between high and medium, and low voting rates

- Accuracy
  - Logistic Regression: 0.68
  - Random Forest: 0.62
  - Decision Tree: 0.56
- Key Predictors: 
  - High Voting Rates
    - Education, Income, Internet Access,
  - Medium Voting Rates
    - Overlapping patterns make it difficult to pinpoint
  - Low Voting Rates
    - Poverty Rate

## Unsupervised Learning Predictions 

## Dimensionality Reduction

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
- **PC1** (driven by income, education, and population) explains **55% of the variance** and is correlated with high voting rates.  
- **Insight**: Socioeconomic conditions are strong indicators of voter turnout.

### t-SNE Clustering  
- t-SNE visualizations revealed distinct groupings:  
  - **High Voting Rates**: Clustered with areas of high income and education.  
  - **Low Voting Rates**: Grouped with higher poverty and fewer resources.  

## Clustering

### K-Means Clustering  
- **Insight**: Voter turnout patterns show two main groups:  
  - **High Voting Rates**: Areas with higher **education levels**, **Asian and White populations**,  **older age demographics**, and **Access to the Internet**.  
  - **Low Voting Rates**: Linked to regions with **Higher Poverty Levels** and larger **African American populations**.

### DBSCAN Clustering  
- **Insight**: Clustering based on density **failed to identify meaningful patterns** due to the **uniform distribution** of data.  

---

### Hierarchical Clustering  
- **Insight**: Similar to K-Meansâ€”regions with **higher education** and **income levels** demonstrate **higher voter turnout**, while areas with **poverty** and **lower education** lag behind.

# Conclusion and Insights

1. **Education Drives Participation**  
   - **Insight**: Areas with **higher education levels** consistently show **higher voter turnout**.  
   - **Action**: Invest in **voter education programs** targeting undereducated communities.  

2. **Income and Poverty**  
   -  High poverty levels correlate with **lower voter participation**.
   -  Higher income regions tend to have **higher voting rates**.    
   - **Action**: Address **socioeconomic barriers** to voting by providing:  
     - Transportation 
     - Childcare support  
     - Paid voting hours 

3. **Demographics**
   - **Insight**: **Asian** and **White populations** vote at **higher rates**, while turnout is **lower** in regions with larger **African American populations**.  
   - **Action**: Develop **culturally relevant outreach campaigns** to incentivize voting among underserved groups.  

  
4. **Internet Access**  
   - **Insight**: Regions with higher **internet access** tend to have **higher voting rates**; this could be due to increased awareness of the news and social media
   - **Action**: Ensure **affordable internet access** in underserved areas to increase voter engagement and awareness.
   -    - **Action**: Increase voter awareness without the use of the internet, including  **community events, workshops**, and **printed materials**
